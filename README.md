# Android Basic NanoDegree: Project1
This is a single page app representing a fictionary invitation/propaganda to join the Pathfinder Society. 

There is nothing special (as expected, given the app nature). 
The main features are:
* ScrollView mainly useful in case of landscape orientation
* For my purposes the costraint layout was much easier to use
* Every string is collected in the string.xml
* I changed the app icon
* I removed the action bar (that doesn't actually have any purpose in this case)
* I associated drawables with some TextView to identify their purpose. 
* I autolinked what I could (which doesn't mean they point to anything real though :smirk:).
